# website-andressa-correa
 This is a bio-site developed for a digital influencer;

 On this site I used HTML and CSS to build and style the pages; and also JavaScript on the coupons page, to copy the code and display the success message

 Initially, the site was developed with MOBILE use in mind.

Therefore, if you are viewing on a computer, use DevTools for a better experience

I'm studying to improve my responsive design.
